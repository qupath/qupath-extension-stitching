Extension.name = Stitching extension
Extension.description = An extension to combine multiple TIFF images into a single image

StitchingAction.title = Stitch images
StitchingAction.numberOfThreads = Number of threads
StitchingAction.numberOfThreadsDescription = The number of threads to use when parsing the input images and writing the output image. A higher value generally increases the speed of the process, but requires more RAM.
StitchingAction.pyramidalize = Pyramidalize
StitchingAction.pyramidalizeDescription = Whether the output image should be a pyramidal image.
StitchingAction.imageFormat = Image format
StitchingAction.imageFormatDescription = The format the output image should have. OME-Zarr is usually faster, while OME-TIFF is usually more used.
StitchingAction.tilePosition = Tile position
StitchingAction.imagePath = Image path
StitchingAction.tiffTags = TIFF tags
StitchingAction.tilePositionDescription = How to determine each tile position.\nIf "Image path" is selected, the position of each tile is determined from the image name.\nIf "TIFF tags" is selected, the position is determined by looking at the "XPosition", "YPosition", "XResolution", and "YResolution" TIFF tags of the image.
StitchingAction.chooseInputImages = Choose input TIFF images
StitchingAction.chooseOutputPath = Choose output path
StitchingAction.warning = Warning
StitchingAction.fileAlreadyExists = A file/directory already exists on the output path. Delete it?
StitchingAction.stitchingFailed = Stitching failed
StitchingAction.fileAlreadyExistsAndCannotBeDeleted = A file/directory already exists on the output path, and it is not possible to delete it.
StitchingAction.stitchingImages = Stitching images...
StitchingAction.parsingInputImages = Parsing input images...
StitchingAction.writingOutputZarrImage = Writing output OME-Zarr image...
StitchingAction.writingOutputTiffImage = Writing output OME-TIFF image... Check the logs for progress.
StitchingAction.stitchingCompleted = Stitching completed
StitchingAction.someImagesCombined = Some of the provided images were combined but not all. Take a look at the logs for more information.
StitchingAction.providedImagesCombined = The provided images were combined.
StitchingAction.errorWhenStitching = The following error occurred when stitching images:\n{0}

ProgressWindow.cancel = Cancel
